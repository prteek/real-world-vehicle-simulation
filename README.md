Modelling to understand the behaviour of a real world vehicle

This repo is an example in how would an electric vehicle behave if it were to replace a conventional vehicle  
using a sample driving trip.  
The idea is to simulate behaviours relevant to battery that are not in the data due to vehicle being a diesel powertrain. 
* Battery current
* Battery State of charge
* Effect of opportunistic charging

Such analysis can help determine the capacity of battery to that can realistically replace a conventional drivetrain.  
In addition it can help design 
* Electric machine/power electronics by understanding realistically required power limits to fulfil the driving cycle
* Charging system by understanding how much opportunistic charging is available and how to maximize it
