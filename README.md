Modelling to understand the behaviour of a real world vehicle

This repo is an example in how would an electric vehicle behave if it were to replace a conventional vehicle  
using a sample driving trip.  
The idea is to extract behaviours relevant to battery namely 
* Battery current
* Battery State of charge
* Effect of opportunistic charging
